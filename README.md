# Real-time Stock Market Sentiment Analysis

This Python project aims to develop a real-time stock market sentiment analysis program that utilizes available libraries and APIs to retrieve live data and provide insights into market sentiment. By leveraging social media, news articles, and user sentiments, the program will analyze the sentiment of individual stocks and generate visualizations to assist users in making informed investment decisions. 

## Key Features

1. **Data Retrieval**: Utilize APIs from social media platforms, news aggregators, and financial websites to collect real-time data on stock market activities, social media posts, and news articles relevant to specific stocks.

2. **Natural Language Processing**: Use libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy to preprocess text data, remove noise, and perform sentiment analysis on social media posts and news articles.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Apply sentiment analysis techniques to determine the sentiment score or polarity of individual posts or articles. Classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

4. **Real-time Data Visualization**: Generate visualizations such as sentiment distribution charts, word clouds, or sentiment over time graphs to provide users with a clear understanding of stock market sentiment.

5. **Stock Market Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of individual stocks based on the weighted average of sentiment scores from social media posts and news articles. Provide insights into the overall sentiment towards each stock.

6. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface to display real-time sentiment analysis results and stock recommendations. The interface could include interactive charts and filters to allow users to explore the data in more detail.

## Benefits 

1. **Real-time Insights**: Users can access up-to-date sentiment analysis of stock market activities, empowering them to make informed decisions in real-time.

2. **Objective Analysis**: By incorporating sentiment analysis, the program provides a more holistic assessment of market sentiment, reducing reliance on subjective opinions.

3. **Efficient Decision Making**: The program helps investors save time by consolidating sentiment information from various sources, enabling quicker and more accurate stock trading decisions.

4. **Visual Interpretation**: Visualizations make it easier for users to grasp market sentiment trends and identify potential opportunities or risks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-sentiment-analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Obtain API keys for social media, news aggregator, and financial websites.
2. Open `main.py`.
3. Replace `YOUR_SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY`, `YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY`, and `YOUR_FINANCIAL_WEBSITE_API_KEY` with your respective API keys.
4. Run the program: `python main.py`.
5. Follow the prompts to enter your API key and analyze the stock market sentiment.

## Code Example

```python
import requests
import nltk
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

class StockMarketAnalyzer:
    # Class implementation
    
    @classmethod
    def run_analysis(cls):
        api_key = input("Enter your API key: ")
        stock_market_analyzer = cls(api_key)
        stock_data, social_media_data, news_article_data = stock_market_analyzer.collect_real_time_data()
        preprocessed_data = stock_market_analyzer.preprocess_text_data(social_media_data + news_article_data)
        sentiment_scores = stock_market_analyzer.analyze_sentiment(preprocessed_data)
        stock_sentiment = stock_market_analyzer.analyze_sentiment_of_stocks(sentiment_scores)
        stock_market_analyzer.generate_sentiment_distribution_chart(sentiment_scores)
        stock_market_analyzer.generate_word_cloud(preprocessed_data)
        stock_market_analyzer.display_results(stock_sentiment)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    StockMarketAnalyzer.run_analysis()

```
